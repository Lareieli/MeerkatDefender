# MeerkatDefender
Space Invaders style Meerkat Defense game

This is the first real repository I've ever put on GitHub, as well as one of my first game projects done while learning C#.

Loosely following the Space Invaders clone tutorial in the Udemy course "Learn To Code by Making Games", I'm attempting to create a short, whimsical "shooter" wherein you summon ally Meerkats to dispatch waves of mortal enemy attackers.

Currently everything is in place, except that I am stuck on how to specify the desired layout of each wave of enemies, and then replace the generic "enemy" game object with the desired enemy type.

Adding to GitHub for the purpose of learning more about version control and to begin a portfolio of fledgling game development.
